                <h2>Joseph Cooper</h2>
                <p> Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar, is a former NASA pilot turned farmer who is selected to lead a mission through a wormhole to find a habitable planet for humanity. Earth is dying due to environmental collapse, and Cooper is driven by his love for his daughter, Murph, and his desire to secure her future. During the mission, Cooper faces numerous challenges, including time dilation, which causes him to lose decades while only a short time passes for him.</p>

                <h2>Murphy Cooper</h2>
                <p> Murphy "Murph" Cooper, played by Jessica Chastain (as an adult) in Interstellar, is the daughter of Cooper, the film's protagonist. As a child, Murph is extremely close to her father and is devastated when he leaves for the space mission. She becomes a brilliant scientist, working under Professor Brand to solve the equation that could save humanity by allowing large-scale space travel. Throughout the film, she struggles with feelings of abandonment, but her connection to her father plays a pivotal role in the story. Eventually, Murph discovers that the "ghost" she believed haunted her room was actually her father communicating with her through time, using gravity from inside a tesseract created by future humans. Her breakthrough in understanding this leads to the solution that saves humanity.

                <h2>Tom Cooper</h2>
                <p>
                    Tom Cooper, played by Casey Affleck (as an adult) in Interstellar, is the son of Cooper and the older brother of Murph. Unlike his sister, Tom takes a more traditional path, staying behind on Earth to manage the family farm as the planet's environmental conditions worsen. While his father and sister pursue scientific solutions to save humanity, Tom is dedicated to preserving their way of life, even as it becomes clear that Earth is dying. As an adult, he faces significant personal struggles, including the loss of his family to disease caused by the planet's failing ecosystem. Tomâ€™s character represents the human side of the film, showing the struggles of those left behind as the planet faces collapse.

                    The daughter of Professor John Brand, Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anne Hathaway in Interstellar) is a vital part of the NASA crew. She goes with Cooper on the wormhole space voyage to find a planet that can support human life. Brand is a bright, tenacious, and caring individual who is devoted to the goal and to giving humanity a new home. She expresses her conviction that love is a transcendent force throughout the voyage, which influences some of her choices, such as her wish to travel to the planet where she loved fellow astronaut Dr. Edmunds was sent.

                <h2>John Brand</h2>
                <p>
                    Professor John Brand, played by Michael Caine in *Interstellar*, is a senior NASA scientist and the mastermind behind the mission to find a new habitable planet for humanity. He is also the father of Dr. Amelia Brand. Throughout most of the film, Professor Brand appears to be working on a solution to solve the "gravity equation," which would allow humanity to escape Earth en masse by creating large-scale space stations. He reveals a Plan A, which involves solving this equation to transport humans off Earth. However, it is later discovered that Brand had secretly given up on solving the equation years before the mission and knew that Plan A would never work. Instead, his real intention was to execute Plan B, which involved using frozen embryos to start a new human colony on another planet. This revelation shocks and disillusions those who trusted him, but despite this deception, his actions were driven by a desperate desire to ensure the survival of the species.
