                <h2>Joseph Cooper</h2>
                <p> Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar, is a former NASA pilot turned farmer who is selected to lead a mission through a wormhole to find a habitable planet for humanity. Earth is dying due to environmental collapse, and Cooper is driven by his love for his daughter, Murph, and his desire to secure her future. During the mission, Cooper faces numerous challenges, including time dilation, which causes him to lose decades while only a short time passes for him.</p>

                <h2>Murphy Cooper</h2>
                <p> Murphy "Murph" Cooper, played by Jessica Chastain (as an adult) in Interstellar, is the daughter of Cooper, the film's protagonist. As a child, Murph is extremely close to her father and is devastated when he leaves for the space mission. She becomes a brilliant scientist, working under Professor Brand to solve the equation that could save humanity by allowing large-scale space travel. Throughout the film, she struggles with feelings of abandonment, but her connection to her father plays a pivotal role in the story. Eventually, Murph discovers that the "ghost" she believed haunted her room was actually her father communicating with her through time, using gravity from inside a tesseract created by future humans. Her breakthrough in understanding this leads to the solution that saves humanity.</p>
